<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am Brenna</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">

<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a freshman in the Swanson School of Engineering studying bioengineering and I also plan on getting an economics minor. I am currently taking a design course called the Art of Making which I am very excited about this semester because I will get to participate in hands-on projects that could actually make an impact on other people. I have wanted to pursue engineering since the beginning of high school and my first semester of college has only solidified that choice.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>I do not consider myself to be an artistic person, but I do believe I am a maker. I have always been the kind of person to try to do it myself when I can't find exactly what I need in a store. Whether it is creating a piece of clothing or room decor, I almost always have the mindset that I can make exactly what I was looking for. In addition, I have some experience with creating content for digital media such as instagram and websites through my participation on the marketing team of Pitt Dance Marathon. I enjoy design both in digital and physical form because in both cases I get to see my ideas come to life as I invisioned. I have only had minimal exposure to digial media and graphic design in the past, so this semester I hope to learn more about how to express my ideas and crativity in a digital manner. </h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>Design is a very subjective topic, but to me a good design is one that draws the eye, includes meaning that goes below surface level, and is cohesive. I have always enjoyed symmetry, I find that when something is symmetrical it tends to look more appealing and I find it to be more organized. I also find monochromatic designs to be very visually appealing. When something is made up of one color in different shades or is in black and white, I find that it draws my attention more and is more enjoyable. Not all designs I find "good" fit this description, but when I create my own projects they tend to fall into these categories.</h3>

    <p><em>I consider all of these images examples of good designs, but each image has a different reason for that distinction. Some I consider good because they are clear, sharp, and precise. Others I like because they draw my attention with their complexity and require more in-depth thought. Despite their many differences, each design is "good" in its own way.</em></p>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After graduating from Pitt I hope to go into the field of prosthetics. I want to do research in this area so that the approximately 35 million amputees around the world will have an improved quality of life. There is amputation performed approximately once every 30 seconds and those people deserve the best prosthetic possible to help them get as much normal function back as possible. The rapidly developing technology of today's world makes it possible to develop prosthetic devices that mimic the sensation of touch and have connections to the brain allowing the user to have cognitive control over the device. The possibilities in the field are endless and can drastically change the way millions of people live. This field connects my interest in medicine and my love of coding and design to congregate in one career. This class can help me succeed in the field of engineering because the ability to be creative, take criticism, revise, and present ideas in a group are all skills I will need on a daily basis. The knowledge I will gain about these skills as well as general design tools will be instrumental in my future career.  </h3>
